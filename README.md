# Founders Circle

A single-page application scaffold using Vue 3 + Vite.

Getting started (PowerShell on Windows):

```powershell
cd X:\Aisha\founders-circle
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

What's included:
- `index.html` — app entry
- `src/main.js` — creates and mounts the Vue app
- `src/App.vue` — top-level component
- `src/components/HelloWorld.vue` — example component

Next steps: tell me which pages or features you want (auth, dashboard, forms, routing, API client, UI library, etc.) and I'll add them.
